# Merger "Types"

---

Essentially two types of mergers:

1. "Within-market"
2. "Out-of-market"


---

## Within-market mergers

- Most well-understood merger type
- Established tools for examination in anti-trust
- Defining the market is still a contentious issue

---

## Within-market mergers

- Listed previously (Emory-DeKalb, etc.)
- **Big** price effects
  - 20 to 40% in many studies
  - Up to 60% in some studies
  - Bigger increases the closer are the hospitals
  - Price increases spillover to other hospitals too
- Account for about 50% of all mergers since 2000


---

## Out-of-market mergers

- Less understood
- No formal structure for analyzing in court
- These types of mergers are essentially permitted without risk of DOJ/FTC challenge

---

## Out-of-market mergers

- Involve larger systems spanning different isolated markets
  - Advocate-Aurora: 27 hospital system in IL and WI
  - Baptist Memorial-Mississippi Baptist: 22 hospitals in TN, AR, and MS
  - UPMC-Pinnacle: 24 hospital system recently added 8 in central PA
  - Catholic Health Initiatives-Dignity Health: 142 hospitals in 21 states
  - HCA: 177 hospitals in 21 states
  - RCCH HealthCare Partners: 89 hospitals in 30 states, focusing on non-urban areas
- About 35% of all mergers are out-of-market but in same state, 15% out-of-state
- Smaller but meaningful price increases, 5 to 10%



# Effects of Mergers on Prices

---

## How do mergers increase prices?

- Already discussed within-market mergers, outside options, and bargaining power
- What about out-of-market mergers?

---

## OOM mergers and prices

Two ways this can happen theoretically:

1. Common customers (hospital markets are local, but insurance markets are more broad)
2. Multi-market contact (particularly relevant for understanding out-of-state mergers)

---

## 1. Common customers

## 2. Multimarket contact

# What Next?

---

## Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies
  - Certificate of need laws
  - Certificate of public advantage
  - Scope of practice laws
  - Any willing provider laws
  - Site-based payment differentials (encourage vertical integration)
2. Antitrust enforcement

---

## A note on surprise billing

Some hope here following the **No Surprises Act** (in effect January 2022):

- Emergency care (excluding ground ambulances?)
- In-network facilities
- New process...
  - OON provider bills health plan
  - Health plan communicates median in-network amount
  - Provider bills cost-sharing to patient

**But** patient can be asked to waive rights

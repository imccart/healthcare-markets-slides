## Outline

- Measuring competitiveness
- Hospital competition in practice
- Different types of mergers


# Measuring competitiveness


## The HHI

- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market


## Cournot Competition Model

- **Objective**: Firms $i = 1, \dots, N$ choose quantities $q_{i}$ to maximize profits.
- **Profit function**: 
  $$\pi_{i} = q_{i} (P(Q) - c)$$

  where:

  - $Q = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_{i}$: Total market output
  - $P(Q)$: Inverse demand function
  - $c$: Marginal cost (assumed identical for all firms)


## First-Order Condition for Profit Maximization

- Each firm maximizes profit by choosing $q_{i}$ such that:
  $$\frac{\partial \pi_{i}}{\partial q_{i}} = P(Q) + q_{i} P'(Q) - c = 0$$

- Rearrange to express the **markup** of price over marginal cost for firm $i$:
  $$\frac{P(Q) - c}{P(Q)} = \frac{P'(Q) q_{i}}{P(Q)}$$


## Deriving the Markup Over Marginal Cost

- Using market share $s_{i} = \frac{q_{i}}{Q}$:
  $$\frac{P(Q) - c}{P(Q)} = \frac{s_{i}}{\epsilon}$$
  
  where $\epsilon = \frac{P(Q)}{Q} \cdot \frac{dP}{dQ}$ is the market demand elasticity.

- Denote the Lerner index by $L_{i} = \frac{P(Q) - c}{P(Q)}$ and derive weighted average:
  
  $$L_{avg} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} L_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} \times \frac{s_{i}}{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\times \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$$


## Connecting Markup to HHI

- Define the **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)** as:
  $$\text{HHI} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^2$$

- **Conclusion**: Higher market concentration (higher HHI) leads to higher markups over marginal cost, linking market power (HHI) to markup in Cournot competition.


## Key issue: Defining the market

Lots of subjectivity...

- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?


# Overall Competitiveness of Hospital Markets


## Trends in competitiveness

Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.

- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

- More data and [interactive report](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals/healthy-marketplace-index/hmi) from the Health Care Cost Institute.
- [Presentation](https://nihcm.org/publications/hospital-consolidation-trends-impacts-outlook) from the National Institute for Health Care Management


## Why?

Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:

- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws...more odd policies to discuss later


# Hospital mergers (horizontal)


## Types of hospitals involved in mergers

![](../figures/nihcm-hospital-types.jpg)


## Types of hospitals involved in mergers

- Ascension-Presence: Largest non-profit system in US adds 10 hospitals to existing 9 hospitals in Chicago
- Fairview-HealthEast: 11 hospital system becomes largest in Twin Cities area
- Hospital corporation of america (HCA) adds 4 hospitals to the 10 existing HCA hospitals in Houston
- Northwestern-Centegra: Forms 10 hospital system in Chicago
- Emory-DeKalb: Forms 10 hospital system in Atlanta
- Jefferson-Einstein: Forms 18 hospital system in Philadelphia area

## Merger "types"

1. "Within-market"
2. "Out-of-market"


## Within-market mergers

- Most well-understood merger type
- Established tools for examination in anti-trust
- Defining the market is still a contentious issue


## Within-market mergers

- Listed previously (Emory-DeKalb, etc.)
- **Big** price effects
  - 20 to 40% in many studies
  - Up to 60% in some studies
  - Bigger increases the closer are the hospitals
  - Price increases spillover to other hospitals too
- Account for about 50% of all mergers since 2000


## Out-of-market mergers

- Less understood
- No formal structure for analyzing in court
- These types of mergers are essentially permitted without risk of DOJ/FTC challenge


## Out-of-market mergers

- Involve larger systems spanning different isolated markets
  - Advocate-Aurora: 27 hospital system in IL and WI
  - Baptist Memorial-Mississippi Baptist: 22 hospitals in TN, AR, and MS
  - UPMC-Pinnacle: 24 hospital system recently added 8 in central PA
  - Catholic Health Initiatives-Dignity Health: 142 hospitals in 21 states
  - HCA: 177 hospitals in 21 states
  - RCCH HealthCare Partners: 89 hospitals in 30 states, focusing on non-urban areas
- About 35% of all mergers are out-of-market but in same state, 15% out-of-state
- Smaller but meaningful price increases, 5 to 10%



# Effects of Mergers on Prices


## How do mergers increase prices?

- Already discussed within-market mergers, outside options, and bargaining power
- What about out-of-market mergers?


## OOM mergers and prices

Two ways this can happen theoretically:

1. Common customers (hospital markets are local, but insurance markets are more broad)
2. Multi-market contact (particularly relevant for understanding out-of-state mergers)


## 1. Common customers

## 2. Multimarket contact

# Final thoughts...

## Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies, [making health care markets work](https://www.brookings.edu/research/making-health-care-markets-work-competition-policy-for-health-care/) 
  - Certificate of need laws
  - Certificate of public advantage
  - Scope of practice laws
  - Any willing provider laws
  - Site-based payment differentials (encourage vertical integration)
2. Antitrust enforcement


## A note on surprise billing

Some hope here following the **No Surprises Act** (in effect January 2022):

- Emergency care (excluding ground ambulances?)
- In-network facilities
- New process...
  - OON provider bills health plan
  - Health plan communicates median in-network amount
  - Provider bills cost-sharing to patient

## Outline for today:

- History of hospitals in the US
- Definition of hospital "price"
- Key facts about US hospital prices


# Some History


## Timeline of hospitcal care in the U.S.

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)
  - Originally paid on a "cost-plus" basis


## How does this play out now?

- Predominately not-for-profit
- Associations with universities, religious affiliations
- Concentration in urban areas, limited access in rural areas
- Opaque pricing and little or no cost management


## Recent developments

- Major technology integration over past 30 years
- Move toward quality improvement programs, pay-for-performance, and mild versions of capitation
- Move toward increasing transparency in prices
- Significant reductions in competitiveness
- Increasing vertical integration (hospitals owning physician practices or insurers owning hospitals)


## Why does any of this matter?

- As we know, we now spend **a lot** on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices (and a big part of that is hospital prices)
- Must understand hospital markets and hospital pricing if we want to address healthcare spending


# What is a hospital's **price**?

In practice, it's a negotiation with insurers

- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

Lots of different payers paying lots of different prices:

- [Medicare fee-for-service prices](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AcutePaymtSysfctsht.pdf)
- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

**Fee-for-service**

- price per procedure
- percentage of charges
- markup over Medicare rates

**Capitation**

- payment per patient
- pay-for-performance
- shared savings

# Key Facts on Hospital Prices

We'll get into the real data later in this module, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive and vary across/within areas

2. Hospital markets are NOT competitive

3. Hospital prices are NOT transparent


## Hospital prices in US

- Recall the high spending on healthcare in US relative to other countries. [Health System Tracker](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/what-drives-health-spending-in-the-u-s-compared-to-other-countries/#Healthcare%20spending%20per%20capita,%20by%20spending%20category,%202021)
- This is largely driven by higher prices. [Health System Tracker](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/how-do-healthcare-prices-and-use-in-the-u-s-compare-to-other-countries/)


## [Price variation](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals-dropdown/all-hcci-reports/hmi-2019-service-prices)

## Discussion questions

- Why are hospital prices so high?
- Why do they vary so much? 
- How might factors like market competition, price transparency, or hospital ownership (non-profit vs. for-profit) play a role?


## Role of Hospital Ownership

- For-profit hospitals tend to have higher prices than not-for-profit hospitals
- Thoughts on why?
- Decent evidence that not-for-profit hospitals still act with strong for-profit motives


## Role of price transparency

- How does the lack of price transparency impact patient behavior and healthcare costs?
- Would making hospital prices more transparent reduce healthcare spending, or would it lead to unintended consequences?


## Role of price transparency

- Price transparency can increase prices by facilitating collusion
- Firms observe each otherâ€™s prices and adjust to match higher competitors' prices rather than competing to lower them
- Undermines competition, as firms coordinate tacitly by setting prices at similar, often higher, levels
- This could play out in healthcare as well, but it's not guaranteed


## Role of competition

- Parkview Health in Fort Wayne, IN offers a good case study of high prices and lack of hospital competition
- See article from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/indiana-medical-debt-parkview-hospital)

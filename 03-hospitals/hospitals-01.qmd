## Outline for today:

- History of hospitals in the US
- Definition of hospital "price"
- Key facts about US hospital prices


# Some History

---

## Timeline of hospitcal care in the U.S.

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)
  - Originally paid on a "cost-plus" basis

---

## How does this play out now?

- Predominately not-for-profit
- Associations with universities, religious affiliations
- Concentration in urban areas, limited access in rural areas
- Opaque pricing and little or no cost management

---

## Recent developments

- Major technology integration over past 30 years
- Move toward quality improvement programs, pay-for-performance, and mild versions of capitation
- Move toward increasing transparency in prices
- Significant reductions in competitiveness
- Increasing vertical integration (hospitals owning physician practices or insurers owning hospitals)

---

## Why does any of this matter?

- As we know, we now spend **a lot** on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices (and a big part of that is hospital prices)
- Must understand hospital markets and hospital pricing if we want to address healthcare spending

# What is a hospital's **price**?

---

In practice, it's a negotiation with insurers


- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

Lots of different payers paying lots of different prices:

- [Medicare fee-for-service prices](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AcutePaymtSysfctsht.pdf)
- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

# Key Facts on Hospital Prices

We'll get into the real data later in this module, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive

2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas

3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

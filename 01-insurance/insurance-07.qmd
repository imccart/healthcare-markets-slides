# "Competition" in health insurance

## Do we want competition in health insurance?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Public Insurance:**

- Simpler with less administrative overhead
- Avoids adverse selection
- Potential for wasteful spending and political influence
- Potentially lower quality

**Private Insurance:**

- Potentially increased efficiency and quality
- Exposure to problem of adverse selection
- Less equitable

## Employer-sponsored Health Insurance, Small Employers

- Small employers select an insurance plan(s)
- Employees choose from available set of plans
- "Buyer" of the insurance product is the employer
- Insurer sells to employer with some expectation of the risk profile and health care needs of its employees

---

## Employer-sponsored Health Insurance, Large Employers

- Large employers typically "self-insure"
- Insurance plan is more administrative, facilitating claims processing and network structure
- Employer actually pays out all costs of health care
- Risk profile less important to insurer (more important to employer)

---

## Managed Competition

Examples of "managed competition" in health insurance include:

- Fully private insurers in exchanges
- Fully private insurers replacing Medicaid (i.e., Medicaid managed care)
- Private insurers alongside public insurers in Medicare Advantage
- All operate with significant federal and state regulations

# Risk Adjustment

---

## Adverse Selection

Those with higher expected health care needs self-select into more generous insurance coverage

- Insurers price generous policies accordingly, leaving healthier individuals out of the market (underinsurance)
- Insurers design plans for healthier individuals or attempt to restrict products for high-cost, sicker individuals

---

## Solving the problem of adverse selection

- The "easy" way: let insurers set prices individually, but this is not good for equity or access
- How else? Managed competition employs **risk adjustment**, essentially introducing a wedge between prices paid by enrollees versus fees received by insurers
- Example: Medicare Advantage, where enrollees pay uniform premiums but CMS pays insurers different amounts based on enrollee characteristics
- Other solutions: plan lock-in and open enrollment periods

---

## Risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage

- Medicare FFS historically had much less healthy enrollees than MA
  - Pre-2000: MA enrollees used 60% as much care as traditional Medicare
  - Pre-2000: "Switchers" into traditional Medicare used 160% more care than average beneficiary
- New risk-adjustment system implemented from 2003-2006
  - Health differences declined to less than 5%
  - [New Risk-Adjustment System Was Associated With Reduced Favorable Selection in Medicare Advantage](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1344)


---

## Challenge of risk adjustment

- Hard to predict who will need the most care
- MA risk-adjustment predicts less than 15% of observed variation in health care utilization
- Mean predictions are pretty close though
- Other barriers: should be interpretable and relatively difficult to manipulate by insurers
- Goal: reduce incentive to disproportionately target healthy individuals without encouraging insurers to manipulate the risk score of their enrollees


# Managed Competition

---

## Need for "managing" competition

- Insurance markets typically highly concentrated
- Demand for insurance is relatively price-inelastic
- Little pressure for more efficient, higher quality "products"

---

## Reasons for market power

In MA, almost all markets are dominated ($\geq$ 95% market share) by no more than 3 insurers. Why?

- High fixed costs of entry (network structure, price negotiations, regulatory requirements)
- Network restrictions from CMS necessitate some network structure

---

## Market power and pricing in MA

Basic structure:

- Plan sets "bid", $b$
- CMS sets a risk adjusted benchmark rate, $B$, based on Medicare FFS costs
- If $b<B$, plan receives $b$ plus some percentage of $B-b$ from CMS as a rebate
- If $b>B$, plan receives $B$ from CMS and $b-B$ is premium

---

## Market power and pricing in MA

Putting profit function in terms of risk units, the plan's problem is:

$$\max_{p_{j}} \left(p_{j} + B - c_{j} \right) Q_{j}(p_{j}, p_{-j}),$$

where $p_{j}$ is the plan's price, $c_{j}$ is their cost per enrollee, and $Q_{j}$ is plan j's quantity (in risk units)

---

## Solution

$$\begin{align}
\frac{d \pi}{d p_{j}} = Q_{j}(p_{j}, p_{-j}) + \frac{d Q_{j}}{d p_{j}} ( p_{j} + B - c_{j}) &= 0 \\
  p_{j} + B - c_{j} = \frac{ - Q_{j} }{ \frac{d Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}} &= \left(\frac{d \ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\right)^{-1} \\
  p_{j}  &= c_{j} - B + \left(\frac{d \ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\right)^{-1} \\
  b_{j}  &= c_{j} + \left(\frac{d \ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\right)^{-1} \\
\end{align}$$

---

## Interpretation

- Price/bid depends on sensitivity of enrollment to benefits
- More competitive means larger response to changes in plan benefits
- Empirical evidence of price elasticity show 10% increase in enrollment from \$10 reduction in bid
- Suggest markups of 10-25% over costs

---

## And?

Curto et al. (2021) study this in great detail...some key findings:

- MA plans provide care at lower cost than traditional Medicare FFS
- But, bids are above what Medicare would otherwise have paid in FFS
- Nearly 15% more expensive to taxpayer
- 40% of "excess" payments go to enrollees in the form of additional consumer surplus
- 60% go to insurers

---

## Key takeaway

- Market design is really important
- Changes in rebate calculation
- Changes in benchmark rates (being implemented now)

---

## Final question - how to measure success?

- Same product at lower cost than public insurer?
- Better product at same cost?
- Larger cost savings with "good enough" product, maybe worse than public insurer?

## What is health insurance

Why do people buy health insurance? What are they "insuring"?

---

Health insurance can still improve health by:

- improving affordability of care (by paying for some part of care when needed)
- facilitating availability of care (providers receive lower payments for "cash" patients)

::: {.fragment}
Made more important due to extremely high healthcare prices

## How does health insurance work?

- Enrollees pay the insurer
    - Fixed amount per month (premium)
    - Some amount for care provided (cost-sharing)
- Insurer pays provider
    - Negotiated prices
    - Pays share of bill depending on cost-sharing terms

---

- Modern health insurance is very complicated!
- Need to work through some basic terminology before we go much further


# Terminology

---

## Managed care

- Health insurance product that encompasses some attempt to manage utilization of health care among its enrollees, often via assigning providers (physicians, hospitals, etc.) into tiers separated based on pricing
- Insurers "manage" care through the use of insurance "networks"

---

## Insurance networks

Set of providers for which the insurer has agreed to pay some amount of care received at those providers, conditional on other cost-sharing terms of the insurance contract
  - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs): tiered network structure, where patients will be responsible for less of the total cost of care when going to a higher tiered provider
  - Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs): more discrete network structure, with some providers in-network and other providers out-of-network

---

## Premiums

What enrollees pay every month regardless of whether they use any health care

## Cost-sharing

Generally refers to the amount of health care expenses that must be paid directly by the patient (as opposed to their insurance plan). The cost-sharing terms of an insurance contract will dictate how much a patient must pay out-of-pocket for any care received. Cost-sharing tends to encompass a **deductible**, **co-insurance**, and **co-payment**. 


---

## Deductible

The amount of money that a patient must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company will pay **anything**

---

---

## Copayment
A fixed dollar amount for which the patient is responsible **after meeting their deductible.** Co-payments are more common for low-cost, predictable health care services like physician office visits. Patients might have a \$20 co-pay for office visits, which means they must pay \$20 for the visit and the insurance company will pay the rest.


---

## Coinsurance

A percentage of costs for which the patient is responsible **after meeting their deductible.** For example, assume you have a 20% co-insurance rate. Assume also that you've met your deductible and that you've received a hospital bill for \$5,000. Then you'd have to pay \$1,000 (20% of \$5,000) to the hospital as your co-insurance. The insurer would pay the remaining 80%. Co-insurance is more common for more complicated or less predictable services, like hospital stays or emergency department visits.

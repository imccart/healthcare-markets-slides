# Motivation


## What is health insurance?

Why do people buy health insurance? What are they **insuring**?



## What is health insurance?

Health insurance can still improve health by:

- improving affordability of care (by paying for some part of care when needed)  
- facilitating availability of care (providers receive lower payments for "cash" patients)

Made more important due to extremely high healthcare prices

## How does health insurance work?

- Enrollees pay the insurer  
  - Fixed amount per month (**premium**)  
  - Some amount for care provided (**cost-sharing**)  
- Insurer pays provider  
  - Negotiated prices  
  - Pays share of bill depending on cost-sharing terms  



## How does health insurance work?

- Modern health insurance is very complicated!  
- Need to work through some basic terminology before we go much further  



# How insurers shape coverage

## Managed care

- Health insurance product that encompasses some attempt to manage utilization of care  
- Insurers "manage" care through the use of **networks** of providers  


## Insurance networks

Set of providers with whom the insurer has agreed to terms of payment  

- **PPOs**: tiered network structure → patients pay less at higher-tier providers  
- **HMOs**: discrete structure → some providers in-network, others entirely out-of-network  


## Benefit design

Insurers also decide:  

- **What services are covered**  
  - hospital visits, prescription drugs, mental health services, etc.  
- **What patients pay**  
  - premium, deductible, co-payment, co-insurance  

This “benefit design” sets the rules for patient payments.  



# How patients pay for coverage

## Premiums

Fixed monthly amount paid for coverage, regardless of whether care is used

## Cost-sharing

Patient payments **when care is used**  

- Deductible  
- Co-insurance  
- Co-payment  


## Deductible

The amount the patient must pay out-of-pocket before insurance pays **anything**  

![](../figures/kff-deductibles.png){fig-align="center"}


## Copayment

A fixed dollar amount for a service (after deductible is met)  

- Common for low-cost, predictable care (e.g., office visits, prescriptions)  
- Example: \$20 co-pay for an office visit  


## Coinsurance

A percentage of costs (after deductible is met)  

- Example: 20% coinsurance rate on a \$5,000 hospital bill  
  - Patient pays \$1,000  
  - Insurer pays \$4,000  
- Common for larger, less predictable services (hospital stays, ER visits)  


## Cost-sharing over time

# Summary

::: columns
::: column
**How insurers shape coverage**

- **Managed care** (steerage via networks)
  - **PPO**: tiered coverage; out-of-network covered but less generous
  - **HMO**: coverage limited to in-network providers
- **Benefit design**
  - **Covered services** (e.g., hospital, prescriptions, mental health)
  - **Premiums and cost-sharing rules** (deductible, co-payment, co-insurance)

::: column
**How patients pay for coverage**

- **Premiums**: fixed monthly payment for coverage
- **When care is used**
  - **Deductible**: amount paid before insurer pays anything
  - **Co-payment**: fixed \$ per service
  - **Co-insurance**: % of allowed amount
- **Network choice matters**
  - **In-network**: negotiated **allowed amounts**
  - **Out-of-network**: provider **charges** (often much higher)

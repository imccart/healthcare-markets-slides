# Overview

---

## Lots of different players

- Physicians
- Nurses
- Hospitals
- Prescription drugs
- Rehabilitation (home health, SNF, rehap hospitals)
- Long-term care (home health, SNF)
- Ancillary services (labs, imaging)

::: {.fragment}
But physicians have an outsized role as they influence almost all areas of health care delivery

---

## Physician training and interactions

- Training, residency, and maybe fellowship...all influence future practice styles
- Primary care vs specialists
- Referrals within and across physician types

---

## Physician organizational affiliations

- Self-employed as part of own practice
- Part of much larger group practice
- Vertically integrated with hospital or insurer

---

## Types of hospitals

- General, acute-care, short term
- Rehab hospitals
- Specialty hospitals (Children's, orthopedic, cardiac, cancer centers)
- Long-term care hospitals
- Inpatient versus outpatient
- Stand-alone surgery centers
- Stand-alone EDs

---

## Ownership type

- Government owned or assisted
- Private not-for-profit
- Private for-profit
- Private equity 

---

## Why does all of this matter

Physicians are often the "gatekeepers" into many other facets of health care:

- Physician is entry point into health care for most patients (even in the ED)
- PCPs refer to specialists and ancillary services
- Specialists refer to ancillary services, other specialists, and may select where to operate (if needed)
- Specialists or hospitalists refer patients to follow-up care after inpatient stays
- All types of physicians help in selecting medications

---

In making these decisions, physicians are influenced by many factors:

- Patient preferences
- Patient "need"
- Knowledge of possible treatments and interventions
- Skill/training in specific interventions
- Payment for different services
- Relationships with other physicians and institutions 

---

## Physician agency

- Physicians more informed that patients
- Physicians can influence what care is provided and where

::: {.fragment}
- **Physician agency** reflects the fact that physicians make/suggest health care decisions on behalf of the patient, so the physician is an "agent" of the patient
- When is this decision more or less similar to what the patient would have made on their own?
:::

# Variation in Health Care Utilization

---

Consequences of physician agency:

- Patients subjected to information frictions or financial incentives of physicians
- The types of care people receive will depend on the physician
- Potential variation in health care utilization and spending across and even within markets

# Variation versus "Waste"?

---

## What does this say about waste?

- Estimates are that more than 30% of health care expenditures are "wasteful": [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)

- Some clear areas of waste:
  - Payment differentials by location of treatment (policy quirks)
  - Better imaging with little benefit
  - Proton treatment (for some conditions)
  - Heart stents (for some patients)
  - Arthroscopic knee surgery
  
::: {.fragment}
But...Many estimates of "waste" are after-the-fact. It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)

# Why focus on physicians?

The U.S. spends heavily to train and employ physicians, and patients place enormous trust in them.  
Yet, across markets, patients with the *same* condition can receive very different treatments.  

::: {.fragment}
Why do highly skilled professionals make such different choices?  
And what does that mean for costs, quality, and equity?  
:::


# Today's Roadmap

1. The structure of health care delivery  
   - How training, affiliations, and institutions shape practice  

2. Physicians as gatekeepers  
   - Why they hold outsized influence over patient care  

3. Physician agency  
   - Information, incentives, and alignment with patient interests  

4. Variation and waste  
   - Evidence from the Dartmouth Atlas and low-value care studies  

# Landscape of Health Care Delivery in U.S.

## Lots of different players
- Physicians
- Nurses
- Hospitals
- Prescription drugs
- Rehabilitation (home health, SNF, rehab hospitals)
- Long-term care
- Ancillary services (labs, imaging)

::: {.fragment}
But physicians have an outsized role, shaping nearly all areas of delivery.
:::


## Training and specialization
- Medical school, residency, fellowship shape practice styles  
- Primary care vs. specialists  
- Referral flows determine how patients move through the system  


## Organizational affiliations
- Self-employed solo practice  
- Group practices  
- Employment by hospitals or insurers  

::: {.fragment}
These affiliations influence autonomy, resources, and incentives.
:::


## Physician–hospital interactions
- General acute-care hospitals  
- Rehabilitation hospitals  
- Specialty centers (children’s, cardiac, cancer, orthopedic)  
- Long-term care hospitals  
- Outpatient vs. inpatient; stand-alone EDs and surgery centers  


## Ownership structures
- Government  
- Private not-for-profit  
- Private for-profit  
- Private equity  

::: {.fragment}
Ownership affects institutional priorities and the constraints physicians face.
:::



# Physicians as Gatekeepers

## Scope of influence
- Entry point for most patients (PCPs, ED)  
- Referrals to specialists and ancillary services  
- Specialists refer further, select surgery sites, order tests  
- Hospitalists/specialists coordinate post-acute care  
- All physicians help determine medications  


## Determinants of decisions
- Patient preferences and health needs  
- Physician training and skillset  
- Knowledge of available interventions  
- Payment incentives  
- Relationships with peers and institutions  


## Physician agency
- Physicians more informed than patients  
- Physicians act as agents, making/suggesting care decisions  

::: {.fragment}
- Key question: Do these decisions align with what patients would choose under full information?  
:::


# Variation in Utilization

## Consequences of agency
- Patients experience physician-driven frictions and incentives  
- Care depends on the physician’s practice style  
- Leads to variation in utilization and spending across and within markets  
- Example: [Is Health Care Shoppable?](https://nihcm.org/publications/is-health-care-shoppable-1)  

::: {.fragment}
Variation raises the question: When is it waste?

# Variation versus Waste?

## How much is waste?
- Over 30% of health care spending may be wasteful [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)  

**Examples**  
- Payment quirks by location  
- Advanced imaging with little benefit  
- Proton therapy for some cancers  
- Coronary stents for low-risk patients  
- Arthroscopic knee surgery  

::: {.fragment}
But: waste is hard to identify prospectively.  
See [MIT report on end-of-life spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628).

# Innovation

---

## What is innovation?

How would you define "innovation" in pharma?

::: {.fragment}
- Should not just mean a new drug, but a new drug that is better than existing treatments
- Not clear this is always the argument made in the media
:::

---

## What governs innovation?

- Strong empirical evidence that firms internalize future profits of a drug when making R&D decisions
- Investment decision can be modeled as:
  1. Ranking of expected returns to potential new drugs, including costs of manufacturing, packaging, marketing, and distribution. This is the Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)
  2. Comparison of MEI to cost of capital
  3. Investment in the drugs to the point where MEI=cost of capital

---

## How to influence innovation?

- If firms are maximizing profits, then the only way to influence innovation is to change the MEI or the cost of capital
- Shift MEI outward via:
  - Changing marketing regulations (DTC advertising)
  - Increasing demand for a drug (market exclusivity, coverage under public insurance)
- Shift cost of capital down via:
  - Easier access to funding (tax credits, grants, etc.)

---

## How to influence innovation?

- Which approach is "best"?

::: {.fragment}
- Politically, these are NOT identical policies
  - Pull incentives require no up-front costs
  - Pull incentives tend to place R&D burden onto pharma customers
  - Push incentives require up-front government investment
  - Push incentives place burden on taxpayers
:::

# Regulation

---

## Key areas of regulation in this market

- Price regulation (reference pricing, direct price caps, etc.)
- In general, lower prices discourages innovation by shifting MEI inward
- How much? Some estimates of price elasticity of R&D at 0.6
  - 10% price cut reduces R&D by 6%
- But what innovations are "lost"? Hard to say

## 1. High Spending

- Higher spending in the U.S. compared to peer countries
- Faster spending growth in the U.S. compared to peer countries

::: {.fragment}
But...

- Spending on even very high cost drugs can still be cost-effective
- Sovaldi (hepatitis C) found to be cost-effective despite \$84,000 per 12-week course

## Research Questions

- What factors seem to contribute to pharma price increases?
- What policies can help ensure prices match value and that drugs are available in an equitable way?

---

## Brand name vs generic

- Annual cost of highly specialized brand name drugs exceeds \$250,000 per patient!
- High brand-name prices now extend to drugs with some substitutes (not just rare conditions)
- Generic drugs generally lower priced, but some examples of high price increases
  - Daraprim, 63-year old treatment for toxoplasmosis, increases 5500% (from \$13.50 to \$750) in 2015
  - A few hundred generic drugs experienced price increases of more than 1000% from 2008 to 2015
  - Why? Monopoly products, despite no patent protection

---

## Why such high prices?

- Prices set by manufacturers, PBMs, insurers, and pharmacies
- Little direct price regulation
- Conversely, the UK specifically requires cost-effectiveness thresholds before allowing coverage

---

## Competition

- Patent protection usually lasts around 20 years (starts before drug is officially approved)
- Companies can apply for extended patent protection for 5 years (max of 14 years in the market)
- Additional 6 months if testing products in children
- On average, 12.5 years of post-market exclusivity for widely used drugs and 14.5 years for highly innovative drugs (first-in-class)

---

Limited competition even for brand name drugs with some substitutes. Why?

- Fragmentation
- Information problems
- Physician agency

---

Firms can also deter generic entry, via:

- Additional patents on coating, method of administration, etc.
  - Example: Nexium is derivative of Prilosec (omeprazole), sold for 600% markup over generic omeprazole
- Significant settlements to generic drug companies
- Delays in approval for generic drugs (FDA delays of 3-4 years, now closer to 1-2 years) 

---

Barriers to substituting brand name drugs with generic drugs even after generic entry:

- Drug product selection laws in 30 states that allow but do not require pharmacists to substitute generics
- 26 states that require patient consent when replacing brand name with generic drugs
- All states allow "dispense-as-written", which restricts pharmacists' ability to substitute brand name drugs

---

Other barriers to competition in among generics and brand name:

- PBMs often paid based on insurer spending on specific drugs, therefore little incentive to intensely negotiate prices
- From US House Committee on Oversight and Government reform:
  
> "The investigation revealed, for example, that Turing received 'no pushback from payors' when it increased 'Chenodal price 5x... [Thiola] price 21x... [and Daraprim] price 43x.'


---

## Justification for high prices

Industry argument that significant R&D costs necessitate higher prices

::: {.fragment}
But...

  - Half of the "most transformative drugs" developed (or started) in academic centers
  - Many drugs also started in small companies later acquired by larger manufacturer
  - "Innovation" means more than just another drug
  - Current price growth simply not sustainable
:::

---

## What can we do?

Federal Policies:

- Limit secondary patents for minor changes
- Combat anticompetitive practices like pay-for-delay
- Allow negotiation of prices and formulary exclusions by Medicare
- Faster time to market for generics

State Policies:

- Drug product selection laws
- Allow negotiation of prices and formulary exclusions by Medicaid

## US Subsidizing ROW

- US clearly pays higher prices than other countries
- Strong evidence that US contribution to profit for future innovation is higher than it should be
- That said, the ROW contribution is meaningful (all other countries do not force prices to marginal costs)
- Authors urge a more international view of spending, suggesting better policy is to advocate for higher prices elsewhere rather than directly for lower prices in the US

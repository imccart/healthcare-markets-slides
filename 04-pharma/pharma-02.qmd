# Pricing for Brand Name Drugs

---

## Price?

- Recall, "price" is confusing in pharma
- Price to wholesaler, to pharmacy, to insurer, to patient
- Significant (and opaque) rebates throughout the supply chain

---

## From Manufacturer's Perspective

Economics of pricing for brand name drugs:

1. Unique, patent-protected drug with no close substitutes (Monopoly)
2. Many products with patent protection and imperfect substitutes (Bertrand differentiated products)

# Monopoly Pricing

---

## Some examples

- Lipitor (lifetime revenue of over $130 billion)
- Humira (lifetime revenue of over $100 billion)
- Advair (lifetime revenue of over $90 billion)

---

## Monopoly pricing without insurance

- Inverse demand, $p=a-b*q$
- Costs, $FC + c*q$
- Profits, $\pi = (a-c)q - bq^2 - FC$

::: {.fragment}

Profit maximizing choice of $p, q$:

- $q^* = \frac{a-c}{2b}$
- $p^* = \frac{a+c}{2}$

## Monopoly pricing with insurance

- If insurers set co-insurance rates and copays based on a fixed price, then it wouldn't matter much
- But...the supply price will vary depending on the form of cost sharing
- Need to consider pricing under coinsurance versus copayments separately

---

## Monopoly pricing with coinsurance

- Denote coinsurance by $\alpha$, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$
- For price $p$, patient pays $\alpha \times p$ and insurer pays $(1-\alpha) \times p$
- Willingness to pay is unchanged, so new inverse demand curve is $p = \frac{1}{\alpha}*(a - b*q)$
- Acts as a rotation of demand, with new slope $\frac{1}{\alpha} \times b$ (steeper demand curve, less elastic)

---

## Monopoly pricing with coinsurance

New profit maximizing choice of $p, q$:

- $q^{*} = \frac{a-\alpha c}{2b}$
- $p^{*} = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{a}{\alpha}+c)$

---

## Comparison of monopoly pricing

- Monopoly price is higher with coinsurance than without
- To see this, let's take the ratio of prices with and without coinsurance:

$$\frac{p^{*}_{c}}{p^{*}_{nc}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} (\frac{a}{\alpha}+c)}{\frac{a+c}{2}} = \frac{1}{\alpha}$$


---

## Monopoly pricing with copayments

- Recall copayment is a fixed amount paid by the patient
- With demand price fixed and independent of supply price, seller can set any price to insurer
- Coinsurance penalizes high prices by working down demand curve, but copayments do not
- Coinsurance shifts burden of price increases directly onto patients and confers downward price pressure relative to case of copayments

---

## Real world example

- Speciality drugs more likely to be unique, with few close substitutes
- Theoretical prediction: coinsurance should be more common with specialty drugs versus more common drugs
- Empirical evidence: coinsurance rates increasing for specialty drugs over time, 25% in 2006 to 33% in 2009

# Bertrand Differentiated Products

---

## Setup

- Many partial (but imperfect) substitute products with market power
- Akin to brand name drug (i.e., with patent protection) with some substitutes
- Simplify to 2 drugs from two companies:
  - Denote demand for drug 1 by $q_{1}(p_{1},p_{2})$
  - Denote demand for drug 2 by $q_{2}(p_{1},p_{2})$
  - $\frac{d q_{i}}{d p_{j}} > 0$, so that products are substitutes
  - $\frac{d q_{i}}{d p_{i}} < 0$, as usual (downward sloping demand)


---


## Specific Bertrand Setup

- **Players:** Firm 1 and Firm 2
- **Actions:** Each firm chooses a price $p_{i}$ for its product.
- **Demand:** The demand for firm $i$â€™s product: $$q_{i} = a - bp_{i} + cp_{j}$$
- **Profits:** Each firm's profit: $$\pi_{i} = (p_{i} - mc_{i})q_{i}$$

**Key Points:**

  - $a$ is the maximum quantity when the price is zero
  - $b$ represents how quantity demanded changes with the product's price
  - $c$ captures the effect of the rival firm's price on demand

---

## Best Response Functions

**Firm 1:** $$p_{1}^*(p_{2}) = \frac{a + cp_{2} + mc_{1}}{2b + 1}$$
**Firm 2:** $$p_{2}^*(p_{1}) = \frac{a + cp_{1} + mc_{2}}{2b + 1}$$

**Key Points:**

- Each firm's price is a function of the other firm's price
- Best response functions represent the optimal price choice in response to the rival's price

---

## Nash Equilibrium

Equating the two best response functions to solve for equilibrium prices:

$$\begin{align*} p_{1}^* &= \frac{a(2b+1) + c(a + mc_{2}) + mc_{1}(2b+1)}{2b+1 - c^2} \\
p_{2}^* &= \frac{a(2b+1) + c(a + mc_{1}) + mc_{2}(2b+1)}{2b+1 - c^2} \end{align*}$$

**Key Points:**

- Nash equilibrium prices are where neither firm has an incentive to change its price unilaterally
- Both firms maximize their profit given the other firm's price

## Comparison to Monopoly Pricing

**Monopoly Price (previously derived):**
$$p_{m} = \frac{a + mc_{m}}{2b}$$

**Comparison:**

- Classical Monopoly vs. Competition: Monopolists set higher prices than competitive firms
- Differentiation: In Bertrand, differentiation can lead to prices closer to monopoly levels, depending on the substitution effect (parameter $c$)
- Cost Structures: Bertrand prices depend on both firms' costs; monopoly price only depends on its own cost

---

## Bertrand Pricing with Insurance

1. **Stage 1:** Insurer chooses one drug with copayment $c$ to be on formulary. Other drug will not be covered at all
2. **Stage 2:** Bertrand pricing with "bids" to insurer
3. **Stage 3:** Insurer selects drug to be on formulary

---

## Solution Idea

- Imagine firm 1 set price to original bertrand price, $p_{1}^{b}$
- Firm 2 can then set price to $p_{2}^{b}=p_{1}^{b}-\epsilon$ and get most or all of the market
- So, $p_{1}^{b}, p_{2}^{b}$ is not an equilibrium
- Firms lower price until extra sales on formularly are less than profit of drug off formulary
- **Final prediction:** Insurers used tiered formularies and copayments for differentiated (but substitutable) on-patent drugs

## Summary from joint hearings in FTC and DOJ

**Unique drugs with patent protection:**

> Under these circumstances, there is little opportunity for a purchaser to stimulate competition among manufacturers. Manufacturers are roughly free to set launch prices, they rarely discount those prices, and purchasers and price takers.

**Differentiated drugs with imperfect substitutes:**

> This stage represents the lion's share of the market at any given time...Depending on how similar the drugs are...organized purchasers have the ability to either switch patients in a medially appropriate way...or at least start new patients on a preferred drug...This is the area where formularies can be applied for the greatest effect on overall costs.
